We try to generate as few bugs as possible, but sometimes it is difficult to perceive bugs impact in our projects in real time and we may not be able to visualize the most affected areas.",

Once we learn what type of bugs are more prevalent in real time, we can then focus on correcting the processes in the affected areas."
